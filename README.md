### ⟡ Core Focus: Algorithmic & Grid Trading

My work revolves around developing and backtesting data-driven models. I'm primarily focused on:
- ⟠ **Grid Trading Systems**: Designing bots that thrive in fluctuating markets.
- ⟺ **Market Analysis**: Statistical edges, regime detection, and anomaly hunting.
- ⌁ **Performance**: Low-latency code paths where microseconds matter.

### ✦ Currently Exploring

- **Rust**: For performance-critical systems and low-latency trading applications.
